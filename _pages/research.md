Same-sex couples disproportionately live in some metropolitan areas in the United States. One reason is the different levels of social acceptance of same-sex couples across areas. This paper shows that acceptance of same-sex couples affects their location decisions, especially those with college degrees, resulting in higher educational sorting of same-sex couples across areas. I derive the mean utility of each city from a conditional logit model. OLS regression results of the obtained mean utility on acceptance show a substantial impact of acceptance on location choices of college-educated same-sex couples. An instrumental variable regression using a novel instrument of the historical number of churches shows a similar effect of acceptance. Counterfactual analysis suggests significant implications for the distribution and welfare of same-sex couples and productivity in an area.

In the United States, same-sex couples disproportionately live in central cities of metropolitan areas, and their presence has often been reported as an indicator of imminent gentrification. In this paper, I suggest two mechanisms that attract same-sex couples into central cities: smaller income elasticity of housing demand and different preferences for downtown/suburban amenities including child-related amenities and cultural tolerance. Analysis based on American Community Survey data provides evidence for these mechanisms. Further analysis using a shift-share instrument shows that metropolitan areas with a higher initial share of same-sex couples downtown experienced a larger increase in average individual income downtown between 2010 and 2017.
