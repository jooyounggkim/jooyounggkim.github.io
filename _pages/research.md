### How do same-sex couples affect central cities?
In the United States, same-sex couples disproportionately live in central cities of metropolitan areas, and their presence has often been reported as an indicator of imminent gentrification. In this paper, I suggest two mechanisms that attract same-sex couples into central cities: income elasticity of housing demand and different preferences for downtown/suburban amenities, including child-related amenities and cultural tolerance. Analysis based on American Community Survey data provides evidence for these mechanisms. Further analysis using a shift-share instrument shows that metropolitan areas with a higher initial share of same-sex couples downtown experienced a larger increase in average individual income downtown between 2010 and 2017.

### Cultural Tolerance and Educational Sorting of Same-sex Couples
Same-sex couples disproportionately live in certain metropolitan areas in the United States. One of the reasons is the different levels of cultural tolerance across areas. This paper shows that cultural tolerance affects the location decision of same-sex couples, especially those with a college degree, resulting in higher education sorting and hence income sorting of same-sex couples across areas. A linear probability model shows same-sex couples are more likely to move to metropolitan areas with higher Democratic vote share, and the degree to which is larger for those with a college degree. Analysis using the variation in the legalization of same-sex marriage across states before the 2015 Supreme Court ruling shows that same-sex couples with a college degree were more likely to move to metropolitan areas in states that had legalized same-sex marriage before 2015. Income regression of movers shows compensating differentials for cultural tolerance for same-sex couples with a college degree.
