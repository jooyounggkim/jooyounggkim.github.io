 <em> "I completed the course feedback form on Friday, but I wanted to personally reach out to you and give you feedback. I was quite hesitant to take this course as I
am a non-traditional student finishing their degree I had started almost XX years
ago. I had not taken an Economics course in that span and I was nervous I would
not remember anything from ECN 101, ECN 102, and ECN 302, courses I had
taken previously years and years ago. I want to thank you for your organization
in preparing the lectures and being extremely knowledgeable and concise about
the information you were teaching. As someone who is taking courses online
from XXXX, your attention to detail should be applauded. The homework and
exams were all fair and reiterated the concepts we learned in your lectures and
from reading. I again want to thank you for a wonderful and challenging summer
course and wish you the best in your teaching endeavors!"
