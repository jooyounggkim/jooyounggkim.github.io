Welcome! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Syracuse University. I am on the 2023-2024 Economics Job Market.  

<br>


My areas of interest lie at the intersection of urban and labor economics. I enjoy working with people and communicating ideas in both informal and formal settings. 

<br>

I can be reached by email: jkim266[at]syr.edu.
